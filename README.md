# What is this all about

Hello everyone,

I am a researcher in web privacy at UPC in Barcelona, Spain. My public profile can be accessed at: [http://hiromipaw.github.io/](http://hiromipaw.github.io/).

Recently I have been working on a study of how web sites track user data and I would like to analyse lightbeam data of real users.

Would you be willing to donate your lightbeamData.json exported from your browser?

If so please send me a PR with your lightbeamData.json renamed as <username>-lightbeamData.json

A preliminary article was just presented this past September at DPM 2015: [http://hiromipaw.github.io/typeinst.pdf](http://hiromipaw.github.io/typeinst.pdf)
